Portfolio for Sara Brizendine

This repository includes the content for Coding Bootcamp's Module 2/week 2 challenge.

## Description
This is my portfolio where I will be adding my projects as I develop and code them. The only project with a deployed application is project, "RunBuddy."

## Software
I have used Visual Studio Code for this project to update the index.html and style.css documents. 


## Portfolio setup
I have added media queries so that the layout is responsive when the page is resized or viewed on screens and devices of various sizes.
